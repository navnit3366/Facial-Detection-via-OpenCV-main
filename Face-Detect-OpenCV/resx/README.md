# What to do in this directory
You must be wondering what was the point of this directory.
This directory will serve as your image resources for image testing and machine learning (but mostly machine learning).

For machine learning, simply place the images of a person in a folder in this directory. I recommend placing at least 10 images to each face 
to increase the algorithm's accuracy.
